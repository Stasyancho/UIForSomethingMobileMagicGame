It's a small mobile project that mainly contains user interface elements. Project have a pie menu, buttons and joysticks. ___It's not example "how you need to do"!___

## What can we do as users?

Left side:

Rightside:

Left joystick responsible for movement, right joystick responsible for direction(spell). 

Right side contains of three statuses:
+ "Off" - you see only button. Pressing button goes to next status(press and release)

# UIForSomethingMobileMagicGame
_a long, long time ago, in a Unity far, far away..._

__Hi everyone. First attempt to do something in Unity, first attempt to create README-file. Let's see what happens.__

## About project
It's a small mobile project that mainly contains user interface elements. Project have a pie menu, buttons and joysticks. ___It's not example "how you need to do"!___

## What can we do as users?
The user interface is divided into left and right sides. 

Left side:
+ joystick

Rightside:
+ button
+ joystick
+ pie menu

Left joystick responsible for movement, right joystick responsible for direction(spell). 

Right side contains of three statuses:
+ "Off" - you see only button. Pressing the button goes to the next status
+ "Cast"- added pie menu.
+ "Direction"

## How does this work?
